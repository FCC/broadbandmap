    <h2>About this page</h2>
    <p>This page allows you to compare data about different areas, either across the country or within one state. Begin by choosing whether you want to compare nationwide or only within one state. Then, choose the type of area you want to compare; choices are States, Counties, Congressional Districts, Census Places (cities and towns), Federally-recognized Tribal Areas and Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSA), which include Metropolitan and Statistical Areas (MSAs) and Micropolitan Statistical Areas. Finally, hit "Compare".</p>
    <p>Data for the country are displayed at the top of the page; and if you search within a state, data for that state overall will also appear at the top of the page. You can adjust the number of rows displayed in the table using the Rows per page pull down at the bottom of the table.</p>
    <p>If you are interested in one particular area, you can sort by the name of the Area (by hitting the triangle next to the Area column heading) and scroll to find the area of interest. Alternatively, you can type the name of the area into the "Filter Area" box to limit the number of rows visible.</p>
