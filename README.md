Fixed Broadband Deployment
======
This application provides a visualization of the residential fixed broadband deployment data collected on FCC Form 477. Facilities-based providers of broadband service report Form 477 data in June and December each year. 

Providers report fixed-broadband deployment data at the census block level. Form 477 data are reported using 2010 Census blocks. Providers may not offer service to every home in every block in which they report service. The calculations used to create the graphs treat every location as having service, and may therefore over-estimate broadband coverage, particularly in areas with large census blocks.

The Form 477 data collection relies on 2010 Census blocks as a standard for data collection. Thus all broadband data displayed on this map use 2010 geometries (2010 block, tract and county definitions). Similarly, the definitions of urban and tribal areas rely on the 2010 Census definitions. Search geometries on the Area Summary and Area Comparison pages (state, county, CBSA, census place, Congressional District and tribal areas) are based on updated definitions.
